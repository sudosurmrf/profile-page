        <h5>My portfolio</h5>
        <p id="portfolio-text">In my portfolio, I've focused on developing a solid foundation in programming and system management, with a particular emphasis on JavaScript and Linux commands. I began my journey as a complete beginner in JavaScript, seeking guidance on foundational topics to enhance my coding skills. Additionally, I've delved into the world of Linux, exploring various commands to better manage and navigate systems. This portfolio showcases my commitment to learning and my progression from basic concepts to more complex applications, reflecting my dedication to becoming proficient in both programming and system operations.</p>
